# Typescript Everything

### Introduction

- TypeScript allows you to leave intent in your code moving your errors from runtime to compile time.
- Rich Editing environment and experience

##### Union and Intersection take their name from - which set of values are allowed to the resultant type built by use of them.

`a | b` means `a` and `b` both & either can be type(A U B), hence it is union, while `a & b` means the resultant type will be both `a` and `b`(A ^ B) -- (and as a result you get everything available on each type(object)).
