//~> Conditional Types - like ternary operator for types
//* some utility types that are based on these conditional types - Extract and Exclude

//! Syntax - condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
//! all these are type expressions

//# T extends <sometype> means T should be **atleast** the sometype by inference or be extended from it etc. -- like a >= comparison
